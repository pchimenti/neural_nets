# neural_nets
This repository contains ipython notebooks which walk through the steps of building artificial neural network models.  The comments will be more detailed than most examples found on the web to faciliate learning.  A list of notebooks with brief descriptions is provided below.  Content will be updated regularly.

*Thanks are due to Facebook for creating and making pytorch public, Udacity and Facebook for teaching everyone how to use it, and Google for the free Google Colab gpu time.  I love that deep learning is now more accessible than ever.*

* income_model_binary_nn.ipynb - This notebook builds a neural net version of the model from the income_model_binary.ipynb notebook in the gradient_boosting repository.  It is a very basic model and is meant only to be instructive.  Some references are made to the boosted tree model previously built.

* transfer_learning_image.ipynb - This notebook exploits transfer learning to build an image classifier.  The well known CIFAR-10 (https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) data set and Inception V3 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567) are used.

* style_transfer - This is a folder containing a notebook and some images to practice stlye transfer.  The materials are simply an adaptation and extension of the notebook made available in Udacity's Intro to Deep Learning With Pytorch course.
