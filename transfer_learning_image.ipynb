    "**Knowing the strengths and weaknesses of a model is very important for two main reasons:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The first reason is that the model can then be used effectively in its current state.  Assigning a degree of confidence to different types of predictions can help to guide decisions made using the model's output.  It may cause someone to ignore certain types of predictions and/or take swift action based on others.  Ignorantly regarding every type of output as the same is a big mistake often made by relatively smart people.  Take the time to learn nuances of any model.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The other reason it is important is because knowledge of the current state can help accelerate development and get the model to a better state.  This could mean changing the inputs, architecture, hyperparameters, etc. of the model and retraining.  In this case, simply training longer would probably yield benefits.  It can also mean treating the probabilities differently.  In the above example automobile is predicted often when the model should be predicting truck.  Perhaps try shifting some of the automobile predictions with high truck probability to a truck assignment and assess accuracy.  There is no law stating that the highest probability gets the prediction.  It is usually the best method.  But there are exceptions.**"
